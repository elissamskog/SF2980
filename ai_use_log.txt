AI USAGE LOG – Project 1
============================

[Date / Time] 2025-11-10 / 22:43
Model: GPT-5 (ChatGPT, OpenAI)
Section: A.1(a)
Student: Elis Samskog
Purpose: Improve search logic for quantiles.
Prompt: "Is there a faster search here for upper bound, if we've already found the lower bound, can we use this to constrain upper bound search?"
Verification: Compared output to output before change, and they were the same accross the same seed.

[Date / Time] 2025-11-10 / 23:20
Model: GPT-5 (ChatGPT, OpenAI)
Section: A.1(b)
Student: Elis Samskog
Purpose: Debugging an index error in exact_quantile_rank_bounds() call.
Prompt: "Why am i getting an index error upon changing the parameters?"
Verification: Trivial, simply call the function again with the new parameter names, restarting kernel fixed it.

Model: GPT-5 (ChatGPT, OpenAI)
Section: A.1(b)
Student: Elis Samskog
Purpose: Create the histogram with the confidence intervals.
Prompt: "Create and style a histogram using matplotlib of all confidence intervals with the closed-form solution"
Verification: Verified by affirming the confidence intervals are generally in the true quantile.

[Date / Time] 2025-11-11 / 10:21
Model: GPT-5 (ChatGPT, OpenAI)
Section: A.2(b)
Student: Elis Samskog
Purpose: Re-writing the VaR and true VaR functions to use the right-tail instead.
Prompt: "Define a loss‐convention VaR and use loss samples and select the right tail of the loss distribution"
Verification: VaR measures the magnitude of losses rather than negative returns according to Hult et al., the sampling error histogram is now centered around 0.
